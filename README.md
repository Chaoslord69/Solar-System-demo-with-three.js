I created this using https://threejs.org/.  

You need to run this on a server according to threejs documentation https://threejs.org/docs/#manual/en/introduction/How-to-run-things-locally.  
In my case i used Xampp.  

Don't forget to install three.js using npm  

Textures used where found on https://www.solarsystemscope.com/textures/  
Planets use dummy values for everything.  
Have not imported any planet satellites yet.
